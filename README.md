Processing app to visualise music based on a collection of input images. The task was to create a music visualizer, but I want to take it more into the direction of a custom visualisation for the music track. The program I wrote allows one to easily add or change images morphed between. These images can be chosen to fit the lyrics or style of the track.

The bass beats vary randomly between affecting the transition between images, the size of the circles as well as a perlin noise based offset for each circle. The transition between images uses a bezier curve for each bubbleâ€™s position.
